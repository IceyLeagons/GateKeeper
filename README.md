# GateKeeper

GateKeeper is our "token manager". It is responsible for storing all the identities of our users.
It automatically refreshes access tokens, etc.

WARNING! This has been developed in a short time period, with no attention on proper implementation of such OAuth services. Due to the possible security
holes this project should not be used in production in its current state.
